# DeepLearning-comparing_CNN_ANN_Pytorch
two simple models to see why convolutional neural networks are so powerful. Testing on CIFAR dataset.
the first model uses convolutional layers and the second uses fully connected layers instead. the point is to do the fastest and simplest comparison between the two. 
the most naive comparison yields a very big difference in accuracy, with CNN getting the upper hand. Interesting to see hands on.
